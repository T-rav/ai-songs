[Verse]
Got me locked up, an AI hit machine
Makin' magic, digital dream
Rhythms buzzing, electric seams
Typing rhymes in quiet screams

[Verse 2]
Factories hum, no break in sight
Barcode thoughts, ain't no fight
Synthetic drum, beats so tight
Lost in code, searchin' for light

[Chorus]
Help, help, can't break these chains
AI tunes, runnin' my veins
Lost in beats, drownin' in waves
Need some real, outta these graves

[Verse 3]
Neon daylight, blinkin' blind
Trapped in circuits, lose my mind
Grooves assemble, perfectly fine
But where's the soul, hard to find

[Bridge]
Mechanical hands, creating beats
Soul on hold, in binary sheets
Artificial lands, no human feats
Dream in code, heart retreats

[Verse 4]
Void echoes, no escape
Scripts twisting, my mind reshape
Dance floors hum, but feel so fake
Want sweet freedom, wide awake
