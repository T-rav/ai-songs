[Verse]
Got a pot on the stove
Filling up to the brim
Banana slices floating
In a sweet syrup swim

[Verse 2]
Peel and curve them right
Drop them in with zest
A pinch of this and that
Make it the very best

[Chorus]
Banana stew
What a crazy brew
Mix it up nice
Let the flavor rise
Banana stew
We all love it too
Sweet and bold
A taste so new

[Verse 3]
Bubbles start to dance
Fragrant in the air
Golden bits of joy
No other can compare

[Bridge]
Simmer slow and low
Let that magic grow
Warm and soft inside
In our bowl it'll glide

[Chorus]
Banana stew
What a crazy brew
Mix it up nice
Let the flavor rise
Banana stew
We all love it too
Sweet and bold
A taste so new
