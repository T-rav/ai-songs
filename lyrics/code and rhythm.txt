[Verse]
Syntax sparking light
Code through the night
JavaScript taking flight
Python feels so right

[Verse 2]
Lines whispering to me
Variables run free
Functions stacking high
Loops go till I die

[Chorus]
Cut the code Debug the node
In this flow I'll never slow
Compile it right We're up all night
Programming dreams in soft twilight

[Verse 3]
Modules fitting tight
C++ in the light
Object classes blend
Till the day we end

[Bridge]
Binary bliss Digital kiss
In the matrix It's hit or miss
Functions we call On the screen they scrawl
Logic rising stand tall

[Chorus]
Cut the code Debug the node
In this flow I'll never slow
Compile it right We're up all night
Programming dreams in soft twilight
