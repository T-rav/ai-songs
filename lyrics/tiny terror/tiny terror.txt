[Verse]
Mr. Fluffles
Beast of night
Slayer
Conqueror of dolls' light
Perched atop the mini-throne
His empire of plastic
His alone

[Chorus]
Tiny house
Your kingdom's foe
Dolls weep
Shadows grow
Fluffles' wrath
An evil show
Children's tears
The darkness sows

[Verse 2]
Claws of fury
Eyes so cold
Toy realm crumbles
Story told
Felines reign
Pure domination
Innocence lost
Devastation

[Bridge]
Mr. Fluffles
Master dark
Prowls without humane spark
Tiny screams
Grim embark
Sitting proud
His colossal mark

[Verse 3]
Doll limbs scattered
Chaos free
No mercy in tyranny spree
Mighty feline
No shame or glee
Terror reigns eternally

[Chorus]
Tiny house
Your kingdom's foe
Dolls weep
Shadows grow
Fluffles' wrath
An evil show
Children's tears
The darkness sows
