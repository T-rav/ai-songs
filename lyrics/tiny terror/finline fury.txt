 [Verse]
Mr. Fluffles pounces
Claws unsheathed
Chaos reigns
Predator unleashed

[Verse 2]
Fluffel around
Mayhem unfolds
Fury in fur
Heart ice-cold

[Chorus]
Mr. Fluffles
Bring the storm!
In his wake
Worlds deform
Feline fiend
Terror's king
Reigns in darkness
Hear him sing

[Verse 3]
Whiskers twitch
Eyes glowing red
Play turns deadly
Blood's been shed

[Bridge]
Mighty hunter
Shadows creep
Night descends
Death in sleep

[Chorus]
Mr. Fluffles
Bring the storm!
In his wake
Worlds deform
Feline fiend
Terror's king
Reigns in darkness
Hear him sing
