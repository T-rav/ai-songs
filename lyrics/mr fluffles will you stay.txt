[Emotional Intro]

[Verse 1]
When you curl up on my lap, your purrs so sweet,
With your fluffy fur and tiny feet,
Will you stay by me through the night,
Or wander off into the moonlight?

[Pre-Chorus - Slow, Whisper]
If I give you my love,
Will you purr here forever?

[Chorus - Melismatic]
Will you stay here, stay here,
When the day turns into night?
Will you snuggle, snuggle,
And make everything feel right?
If I give you all my heart,
Will you promise not to part?
Will you stay here, stay here,
My little fluffy delight?

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
I promise to give you treats and toys, and love you every day,
If you share your playful moments, in your special kitty way.
Don't be scared of the thunder that roars in the sky,
I'll hold you close and keep you warm, never say goodbye.

[Pre-Chorus - Slow, Whisper]
If I give you my love,
Will you purr here forever?

[Chorus - Emotional]
Will you stay here, stay here,
When the day turns into night?
Will you snuggle, snuggle,
And make everything feel right?
If I give you all my heart,
Will you promise not to part?
Will you stay here, stay here,
My little fluffy delight?

[Post-Chorus]
Will you stay here, stay here?!

[Bridge - Belting]
Oooo, oh, oh
Oooo, oh, oh

[Chorus - Belting]
Will you stay here, stay here,
When the day turns into night?
Will you snuggle, snuggle,
And make everything feel right?
If I give you all my heart,
Will you promise not to part?
Will you stay here, stay here,
My little fluffy delight?

[Outro - Melancholy]
If I give you all my heart,
Will you promise not to part?
Will you stay here, stay here,
Forever, never apart?
