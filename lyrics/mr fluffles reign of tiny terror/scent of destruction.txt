[Intro - Energetic Guitar Riff]

[Verse 1]
Morning light, breaking through the haze,
Mr. Fluffles starts his crazy craze.
Shoes lined up, a tempting sight,
He dives right in, with all his might.

[Pre-Chorus - Playful]
Leather, canvas, laces too,
Every scent is something new.

[Chorus - Explosive]
Scent of destruction, it's his delight,
Mr. Fluffles, day and night.
Scent of destruction, his favorite game,
In every pair, he stakes his claim.

[Verse 2]
Sneakers, boots, sandals, and heels,
Every shoe holds a secret appeal.
Nose to the ground, he's on the trail,
Following scents, without fail.

[Pre-Chorus - Playful]
Leather, canvas, laces too,
Every scent is something new.

[Chorus - Explosive]
Scent of destruction, it's his delight,
Mr. Fluffles, day and night.
Scent of destruction, his favorite game,
In every pair, he stakes his claim.

[Bridge - Guitar Solo]

[Chorus - Powerful]
Scent of destruction, it's his delight,
Mr. Fluffles, day and night.
Scent of destruction, his favorite game,
In every pair, he stakes his claim.

[Outro - Energetic Instrumental]
Mr. Fluffles, with his nose so keen,
In a world of shoes, he's the sniffing machine.
Scent of destruction, his endless quest,
In his heart, this love's the best.
