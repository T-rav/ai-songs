[Intro - Haunting Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
In the shadows, silent and sly,
A pair of eyes, that never lie.
Following footsteps, a ghostly guide,
In every room, where secrets hide.

[Pre-Chorus - Whisper]
Silent paws, in the dark they creep,
A watchful gaze, never asleep.

[Chorus - Rhythmic]
Shadow stalker, always near,
In the darkness, I feel your fear.
Shadow stalker, lurking low,
Everywhere I go, you follow.

[Verse 2]
From room to room, through night and day,
A haunting presence, you cannot sway.
Stealthy moves, a hidden trace,
Always watching, no hiding place.

[Pre-Chorus - Whisper]
Silent paws, in the dark they creep,
A watchful gaze, never asleep.

[Chorus - Rhythmic]
Shadow stalker, always near,
In the darkness, I feel your fear.
Shadow stalker, lurking low,
Everywhere I go, you follow.

[Bridge - Eerie Guitar Solo]

[Chorus - Haunting]
Shadow stalker, always near,
In the darkness, I feel your fear.
Shadow stalker, lurking low,
Everywhere I go, you follow.

[Outro - Haunting Instrumental]
In the stillness, your presence known,
A shadow's whisper, chills to the bone.
Shadow stalker, in the night,
Ever watching, out of sight.
