[Intro - Thunderous Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
In the dark of night, he awakens with a growl,
Eyes of fire, and a thirst for a prowl.
Silent steps, claws ready to strike,
From furniture to skin, none can escape his might.

[Pre-Chorus - Ferocious]
Unleashed fury, with a deadly swipe,
Marking his territory, with claws of hype.

[Chorus - Powerful]
Mr. Fluffles, Claw of Doom,
Ripping through the midnight gloom.
Unstoppable force, none can flee,
This is his reign, wild and free.

[Verse 2]
Shredding through fabric, tearing through flesh,
Leaving trails of chaos, his power fresh.
No corner is safe, no surface spared,
In his realm of carnage, he stands prepared.

[Pre-Chorus - Ferocious]
Unleashed fury, with a deadly swipe,
Marking his territory, with claws of hype.

[Chorus - Powerful]
Mr. Fluffles, Claw of Doom,
Ripping through the midnight gloom.
Unstoppable force, none can flee,
This is his reign, wild and free.

[Bridge - Guitar Solo]

[Chorus - Belting]
Mr. Fluffles, Claw of Doom,
Ripping through the midnight gloom.
Unstoppable force, none can flee,
This is his reign, wild and free.

[Outro - Thunderous Instrumental]
Claw of Doom, his legacy,
In the shadows, he reigns supreme.
A feline terror, fierce and bold,
In his kingdom, stories unfold.

[End]
