[Instrumental - shredding]

[Verse]
Furball rising
Deep within!
Mr. Fluffles
Battle begins!
Claws extend
Throat tight
Grinding
Feline fury
Relentless pounding!

[Verse 2]
Stomach's turmoil
Endless thrashing!
Paws to ground
Throat is gnashing!
Eyes of fire
Hell unleashed
Hairball's grip
Refuse to release!

[Chorus]
Throat shredder! Death machine!
Unleash the cries
Unseen!
Feline warrior
Savagery's call
Banished the beast within — the hairball!

[Breakdown - Instrumental]

[Spoken Word]
In the quiet of the night,
A battle rages on.
A warrior’s plight,
A feline’s song.
Through pain and strife,
He fights his own,
To conquer the beast,
And reclaim his throne.

[Bridge]
Purring turns to growls of torment!
Felt the agony
Every moment!
Mighty feline
Throat implore
Conquer the fur that makes you roar!

[Verse 3]
Oozing vile from the depths inside
No escape
Must collide!
Power surges
Last exhale
Mr. Fluffles
Eternal wail!

[Chorus]
Throat shredder! Death machine!
Unleash the cries
Unseen!
Feline warrior
Savagery's call
Banished the beast within — the hairball!
