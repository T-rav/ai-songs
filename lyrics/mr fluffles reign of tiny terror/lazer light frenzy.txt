[Intro - Frantic Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
In the dark of the night, a red dot appears,
Mr. Fluffles sees it, and the chase is near.
Eyes wide open, claws ready to strike,
A laser light frenzy, wild and bright.

[Pre-Chorus - Intense]
Paws pound the floor, a feline in flight,
Chasing shadows, through the night.

[Chorus - Explosive]
Laser light frenzy, a wild pursuit,
Mr. Fluffles in a high-speed route.
Laser light frenzy, can't slow down,
In this game, he's the king of the town.

[Verse 2]
Bouncing off walls, a blur of black fur,
Every move precise, no time to deter.
The dot dances wildly, across the room,
A feline warrior, sealing its doom.

[Pre-Chorus - Intense]
Paws pound the floor, a feline in flight,
Chasing shadows, through the night.

[Chorus - Explosive]
Laser light frenzy, a wild pursuit,
Mr. Fluffles in a high-speed route.
Laser light frenzy, can't slow down,
In this game, he's the king of the town.

[Bridge - Frantic Guitar Solo]

[Chorus - Powerful]
Laser light frenzy, a wild pursuit,
Mr. Fluffles in a high-speed route.
Laser light frenzy, can't slow down,
In this game, he's the king of the town.

[Outro - Energetic Instrumental]
The dot fades away, but the thrill remains,
In Mr. Fluffles' heart, the wildness sustains.
Laser light frenzy, a nightly spree,
Forever a part of his feline legacy.
