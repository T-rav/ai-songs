[Intro - Aggressive Guitar Riff and Thunderous Drums]

[Verse 1]
In the shadows, eyes aglow,
Mr. Fluffles, ready to show.
A feather toy, his prey in sight,
The hunt begins, with all his might.

[Pre-Chorus - Ferocious]
Paws strike fast, a blur of speed,
In this battle, he will succeed.

[Chorus - Explosive]
Winged menace, can't escape,
Fluffles' fury, seals your fate.
Winged menace, relentless fight,
Feathered prey, through day and night.

[Verse 2]
Silent stalker, moves with grace,
Determined look, on his face.
Pouncing high, claws extended wide,
No retreat, nowhere to hide.

[Pre-Chorus - Ferocious]
Paws strike fast, a blur of speed,
In this battle, he will succeed.

[Chorus - Explosive]
Winged menace, can't escape,
Fluffles' fury, seals your fate.
Winged menace, relentless fight,
Feathered prey, through day and night.

[Bridge - Intense Guitar Solo]

[Chorus - Powerful]
Winged menace, can't escape,
Fluffles' fury, seals your fate.
Winged menace, relentless fight,
Feathered prey, through day and night.

[Outro - Heavy Bass and Drum Riff]
In the shadows, the hunt goes on,
Winged menace, dusk till dawn.
Mr. Fluffles, the mighty chase,
In this game, he finds his place.
