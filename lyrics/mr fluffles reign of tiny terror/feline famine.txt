[Intro - Intense Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
5 AM, the silence breaks,
A shadow moves, the hunger aches.
Claws on the bed, a relentless force,
A feline hunger, setting its course.

[Pre-Chorus - Fierce]
Dragging paws, a primal cry,
In the darkness, under the sky.

[Chorus - Powerful]
Feline famine, the battle begins,
Demanding food, with piercing grins.
Pawing at the floor, eyes of fire,
Feeding time, the cat's desire.

[Verse 2]
No rest for the weary, no peace in sight,
The struggle rages on through the night.
A furry fiend, with a starving plea,
In this war for food, will you see me?

[Pre-Chorus - Fierce]
Dragging paws, a primal cry,
In the darkness, under the sky.

[Chorus - Powerful]
Feline famine, the battle begins,
Demanding food, with piercing grins.
Pawing at the floor, eyes of fire,
Feeding time, the cat's desire.

[Bridge - Guitar Solo]

[Chorus - Belting]
Feline famine, the battle begins,
Demanding food, with piercing grins.
Pawing at the floor, eyes of fire,
Feeding time, the cat's desire.

[Outro - Intense Instrumental]
Relentless cries, in the early morn,
A hunger quest, from dusk till dawn.
Feline famine, the call to feed,
In this struggle, my only need.
