[Intro - Thunderous Drum and Bass Riff]

[Verse 1]
On the couch, the king reclines,
Mr. Fluffles rules, his power defines.
Eyes half-closed, but don't be fooled,
In his dreams, the kingdom's ruled.

[Pre-Chorus - Intense]
Paws of steel, a mighty yawn,
In the darkness, he's the dawn.

[Chorus - Explosive]
Sovereign slumber, fierce and grand,
A feline force, takes command.
Sovereign slumber, heavy might,
Drifting in and out of night.

[Verse 2]
Whiskers twitch, claws at rest,
In his realm, he is the best.
Silent roars, in shadows deep,
Fluffles reigns, even in sleep.

[Pre-Chorus - Intense]
Paws of steel, a mighty yawn,
In the darkness, he's the dawn.

[Chorus - Explosive]
Sovereign slumber, fierce and grand,
A feline force, takes command.
Sovereign slumber, heavy might,
Drifting in and out of night.

[Bridge - Ferocious Guitar Solo]

[Chorus - Powerful]
Sovereign slumber, fierce and grand,
A feline force, takes command.
Sovereign slumber, heavy might,
Drifting in and out of night.

[Outro - Heavy Bass Riff]
In the stillness, power flows,
Sovereign slumber, the legend grows.
Mr. Fluffles, mighty king,
In his dreams, he reigns supreme.
