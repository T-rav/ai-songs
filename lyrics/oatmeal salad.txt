[Intro - Upbeat Synth Melody]

[Verse 1]
Wake up in the morning, feeling fresh and bright,
Time to make a breakfast that feels just right.
Got my oats and fruits, all set to go,
Mix it all together, let the flavors flow.

[Pre-Chorus - Playful]
Healthy and tasty, it's the way to start,
Oatmeal salad, it's a work of art.

[Chorus - Catchy]
Oatmeal salad, so fresh and light,
Mix it up, make it right.
Oatmeal salad, every bite,
A burst of flavor, pure delight.

[Verse 2]
Add some berries, nuts, and a touch of spice,
Drizzle honey, make it oh-so-nice.
Creamy yogurt or a splash of milk,
Oatmeal salad, smooth as silk.

[Pre-Chorus - Playful]
Healthy and tasty, it's the way to start,
Oatmeal salad, it's a work of art.

[Chorus - Catchy]
Oatmeal salad, so fresh and light,
Mix it up, make it right.
Oatmeal salad, every bite,
A burst of flavor, pure delight.

[Bridge - Synth Solo]

[Chorus - Upbeat]
Oatmeal salad, so fresh and light,
Mix it up, make it right.
Oatmeal salad, every bite,
A burst of flavor, pure delight.

[Outro - Energetic Synth Melody]
Start your day with something grand,
Oatmeal salad, take a stand.
Healthy choices, feeling great,
Oatmeal salad, celebrate!
