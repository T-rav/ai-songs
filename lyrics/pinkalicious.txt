[Verse]
She's pinkalicious yeah
She is so delicious yeah
Got the fur that's soft and fine
She's the sparkle every time

[Verse 2]
In the morning light she shines
Little paws
She weaves her rhymes
No other cat quite like her flair
She's my pink wonder so rare

[Chorus]
Pinkalicious
She's my queen
In the night
In every dream
Pinkalicious
Takes my heart
Never want to be apart

[Bridge]
She purrs a melody so sweet
Dancing on her dainty feet
Pinkalicious
She's a star
In my heart
Never far

[Verse 3]
Tail sways like a gentle breeze
Curling up with perfect ease
Eyes so bright
They light my world
Pinkalicious magic girl

[Chorus]
Pinkalicious
She's my queen
In the night
In every dream
Pinkalicious
Takes my heart
Never want to be apart
